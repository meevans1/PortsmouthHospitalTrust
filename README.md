## Update results with new events

To update with new results you need access to the Datix SQL server at PHT with ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly;
Ask the IT dev team for the server name.

1. Download 32-bit Python 3.7 Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ (you'll need permission to get this on a RICH client).

(you'll need permission to get this on a RICH client).

6. Once the SNOMED ZIP has downloaded, unzip it and move the file sct2_Description_Snapshot-en_INT_20190731.txt to C://Users/your_username/PortsmouthHospitalTrust

7. Open the webpage where Jupyter should've opened (e.g. Chrome).

9. Ask the IT dev team for the server name and database for the file you want to run. The server name starts with L_AAG. For the diagnosis folder you should ask for the old bedview server and database name. For the patient safety folder you should ask for the Datix server and database name.
